## Featured Projects

### Project 1: Predicting Customer Churn
**Description**: In this project, I developed models to predict customer churn for a subscription-based business. Using logistic regression and decision trees, I focused on identifying high-risk customers to inform retention strategies.

- **Key Techniques**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Feature Engineering
- **GitHub Repository**: [Customer Churn Project](https://github.com/username/data-competitions-projects/tree/main/customer-churn)

### Project 2: Sales Forecasting for Retail Stores
**Description**: I built a time series forecasting model to predict monthly sales for a retail chain. This project involved seasonality analysis and trend decomposition to create accurate sales predictions.

- **Key Techniques**: Time Series Analysis, ARIMA, Seasonal Decomposition
- **GitHub Repository**: [Sales Forecasting Project](https://github.com/username/data-competitions-projects/tree/main/sales-forecasting)

### Project 3: Image Classification for Wildlife Conservation
**Description**: In this project, I used deep learning to classify images of animals captured by remote wildlife cameras. My focus was on developing a convolutional neural network that could handle imbalanced data and varying image conditions.

- **Key Techniques**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning
- **GitHub Repository**: [Wildlife Classification Project](https://github.com/username/data-competitions-projects/tree/main/wildlife-classification)
